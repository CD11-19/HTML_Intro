        * Must ALWAYS go 1st -- 1st line of the HTML file
        *Informs the browser which version of HTML will be used
        *Is a DECLARATION and not really a "tag"
        *DOCTYPE tag MUST be typed first, bc it dictates the version 
            of HTML used. Declaring the type of code language to be used.
    html:
        *R00T element= top level tag, represents the entire HTML doc

    Basic Structure
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>

            <head>
                <title> </title>
            </head>

            <body>
            </body>
        </html>

    a div/division is a block level division of your code
    a section where related information will be put together 

    <div class="block-element">
        <h1>
            THis is a block level element
        </h1>

        <p>
            Block elements take up the full available width
            It will start on a NEW LINE
            They can contain other block and inline elements
        </p>
    </div>

    The counterpart to a div is a SPAN~~~~~~
    It is NOT  a block level element.
    Instead, it is an inine-level element
    A line tag

    <span class="inline-element"> This</span>
    <span class="inline-element"> is</span>
    <span class="inline-element"> an</span>
    <span class="inline-element"> inline</span>
    <span class="inline-element"> element</span>
